## Tech stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Static Site Generator
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Hosting
- [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/products/identity/) - Authentication
- [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) - CMS
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styling

## How it works

- Static site generation on Netlify
- Decap CMS pushes changes to github which are redeployed in under a minute
- Requires Netlify Identity (Can be manually replaced with other Oauth services)

  - Preview styles and templates won't be applied in dev server, but the cms will work
  - For actual use / local testing it's best to `pnpm run build && pnpm run preview`
  - If you are using windows you will need to edit the [package.json](./package.json)'s `dev` and `preview` commands to `"dev": "start decap-server & start astro dev"` and `"preview: "start decap-server & start astro preview"`

- Netlify Identity widget must be on root page ( is in `src/layouts/PageLayout.astro` but only needs to be on root page ) and `/admin`
- The decap admin board is preconfigured with preview styles built from the tailwind of our project and to only show the body in the preview ( personal preference of mine can be removed by removing the scripts in `/pages/admin.astro`)
- Tailwind typography for styling the blogs
